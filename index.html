    <p>Hello, my name is Kurt Timothy Aston C. Valdecañas. I am 20 years old, and my birthday is on August 9, 2004. I became interested in pursuing computer science
        before I graduated SHS. I am currently learning how to manage my time properly. Discipline is my weak suit.

    <p>Hello, I am Ralph Jaisell S. Cruz. I'm turning 21 years old this year on October 3. I've been interested with computers and stuff when I was young so 
        when I had to choose a college program I ended up picking Computer Science. Even though it is hard at times, I still think that it is an interesting field and 
        it is also relevant to our present community. I'm working hard as a student and will continue to do so when the time comes that I have to go to the actual field.
