    <p>
        I was born at Balanga, Bataan in ICMC. At an early age, my family and I transferred to Manila to live there. Over the next couple of years we lived Caloocan City. There I went through nursery up until 5th grade.
        I developed a sense of understanding my family's situation around that grade.
    </p> <br />
    <p>
        Before I went to 6th grade, my family transferred back to Balanga, Bataan and I continued my studies there until today. This is due to some personal reasons.
        Until then, I enjoyed doing illustrations and playing games in my free time. I also like eating. Sometimes, I enjoy endulging in music via playing the piano.
    </p> <br />
    <p>
        After graduating in SHS, I decided to transfer to BPSU as it was relatively close to our home. This decision helped my family and I save up. My mother is a single mom and
        she has been working overseas to provide for me and my siblings. During the quarantine, I started to draw and enjoyed it. Hence, the fact that I now do illustrations.
    </p> <br />
    <p>
        During this time, I enrolled to BPSU. Over the course of a couple semesters, my mother decided to retire temporarily before having birth to my youngest sibling. 
        Before she gave birth, she lived in our grandparents' home for the time being. This is at the same time my stepfather was working in Canada. My siblings and I enjoyed
        our mother's company before she had to leave after giving birth to take care of our youngest sibling.
    </p> <br />
    <p>
        In my time at BPSU, I enjoyed learning and getting to know new people. I also further endugled on my hobbies and aspire to create a living off of them some day. 
        Now, I usually try to join on drawing contests. My goal is hone my craft further. During this, I also wish to learn much more about my course and how I can hone them.
