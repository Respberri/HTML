    <h1>About The Members</h1>

    <p>
        I am Marc Steven G. Nagamany, 21 years old. I am of mixed Sri-Lankan and Filipino roots. I was born in General Tinio, Nueva Ecija, and grew up in Mariveles, Bataan. I am currently a 3rd year Computer Science student majoring in Software Development in Bataan Peninsula State University. 
    
        I grew up in a Christian family and environment, and initially attending church because of them.
    </p> <br />
    <p>However, as I matured—not just in age, but in faith—I began to truly understand who God is. I’ve come to know His amazing grace, forgiveness, and unconditional love. It is deeply freeing to realize that my worth isn’t determined by what I do, nor am I condemned by my sins. Instead, I am deeply loved by a Father who sees me as I am and loves me still. 
        Growing up, I learned to play various musical instruments through my involvement in church, which became the foundation of my love for music. 
    </p> <br />
    <p>
        Over time, I developed my skills and passion for playing the keyboard, bass, and guitar. Music has become an integral part of my life. It allowed me to express my creativity and emotion, both in personal and collaborative setting. Now, about my course, I won't lie, it is very challenging. There are times that the wide spectrum of knowledge and information overwhelms me. 
    </p> <br />
    <p>  
        Yet, as cliche as it is, challenges makes you stronger and wiser. I am constantly learning, pushing forward, and even crawling through at times. I look forward to the journey ahead, with its tougher challenges, and more importantly, to the satisfaction of overcoming each one. My journey in life has been shaped by faith, music and pursuit of growth. It has molded me into someone who values perseverance and purpose.
	</p> <br />
    <p>
        In addition to my faith and love for music, I have always been drawn to technology and how it shapes the modern world. From an early age, I was curious about how things worked behind the scenes, whether it was a computer program or a mobile app. This curiosity eventually led me to pursue Computer Science, where I discovered a genuine passion for coding and problem-solving. I enjoy the process of creating efficient and effective solutions to real-world problems through software development. My ultimate goal is to become a software engineer who not only builds reliable systems but also contributes positively to society through innovation and ethical technology practices.
