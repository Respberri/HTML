    <h1>My University</h1>
    <p>
        Kurt -- I am currently enrolled at Bataan Peninsula State University Main. I am at my third year of computer science, with a specialization at software development.
        The experience so far has been relatively good, minus our building getting demolished mid-sy.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, in spite of this, the first year of comsci has teached me a lot about the university and my program. BPSU is a unique environment for learning. It is lively whenever
        there's an event; and in contrast, each college facilitates learning in a constructive and effective way.
    </p>
    <p>
        In three years, my experience in software development often has its ups and downs. At times, though I understand our circumstances of not having a proper college building,
        learning has become unengaging which drastically reduces my performance and willingness to properly learn new things. However, the upside is having the freedom to learn more
        about what I am passionate about, outside of my program. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In light of this, I still admire my professors. They are hardworking. Also, steadfast in teaching us students.
    </p>
    <p>
        Although BPSU has its fair share of struggles, the university is still a viable choice to preparing us students to a bright career path. Not only because of its environment,
        but also because of its professors.
