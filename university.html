    <h2>About BPSU Main</h2>
    <p>
        BPSU is a unique environment for learning. It is lively whenever there's an event. Likewise, each college facilitates learning in a constructive and effective way.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are various different colleges throughout BPSU Main. These are: CEA, CNM, CCST, CBA, CTEC, CAS. Each college offers unique programs that suit their specialization.
    </p>
    <p>
        Furthermore, BPSU Main holds the largest amount of students in its campus. Every school year, there are thousands of applicants. BPSU is very inclusive in accepting 
        students, thus explaining the reason as to why there are such large amounts of applicants per year.
    </p>
    <p>
        Inside the campus, there are various sheds, buildings, and hotspots where students can hangout and/or study. The campus library is a great spot for students to experience
        a solitary or secluded environment to review their lesson or to do their activities quietly. In here, a wide arrangement of books and materials are publicly accessible to
        help students learn more about their specific program, or general knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
        In light of this, BPSU Main is a great university with a diverse sets of students, colleges, and professors.

    <h2>About Our Program</h2>
    <p>Computer Science is a dynamic and rapidly evolving field that focuses on the study of computers and computational systems. It encompasses a wide range of topics including 
        algorithms, data structures, software engineering, artificial intelligence, and more.
    </p>
    <p>
        The field of Computer Science can be broadly divided into several core areas. Algorithms and data structures form the backbone, enabling efficient problem-solving and 
        data management. Computer systems and networks study the hardware and software that make up computing systems.
    </p>
    <p>
        In BPSU, CCST makes up the following: Software Development, Network and Data Communication, Net and Web Application, Digital Animation, and Game Development. Each with its
        ties to the foundation of Computer Science, but varying differently across multiple media, application, and development.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our program, Software Development, is a critical subfield of Computer Science that involves the creation, design, and maintenance of software applications. 
        It includes various phases such as requirement analysis, design, coding, testing, and maintenance. Software developers use programming languages like Python, Java, and C++ 
        to write code and create software that can range from simple applications to complex systems. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The principles and skills learned in Computer Science are applied in numerous real-world scenarios. From developing mobile apps and web platforms to creating sophisticated 
        algorithms for data analysis, the impact of software development is important. Industries such as healthcare, finance, entertainment, and education rely heavily on 
        software solutions to enhance their services and operations.
