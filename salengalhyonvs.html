    <p>
	I’ve always been someone who values simplicity and calm in life. My routine is straightforward: I stay at home most of the time, making the most of my 24 hours by focusing on my studies at Bataan Peninsula State University and enjoying the things that matter to me. I live near the junkshops in the west section of Orani, which gives my life a certain kind of stillness that I appreciate. This quiet lifestyle helps me focus on what I love computer science and drawing.

	When it comes to computer science, I’ve always believed that the field reflects the same peace and structure I try to maintain in my life. There’s something meditative about coding whether it’s solving a problem or creating a new program, it’s like constructing a perfect puzzle. I work through algorithms and data structures with the same calm focus I apply to my everyday life. Coding allows me to think logically and methodically, yet it also provides room for creativity, especially when developing new solutions or designing software.

	Art, on the other hand, is where I let my mind wander freely. Drawing has been a passion of mine for as long as I can remember. It’s the one area where there’s no need for strict rules or algorithms. It’s just me, a pencil, and a blank sheet of paper. While computer science is about precision and clarity, drawing is where I explore ideas without limits. The contrast between the two disciplines is something I really enjoy they balance each other in my life.
	</p>
	<p>
	While I enjoy the quiet life, it doesn’t mean I shy away from challenges. In both my personal life and studies, I approach problems with a calm determination. Whether it’s a complex coding project or an intricate drawing, I take the time to carefully plan my approach. And even though I tend to avoid conflicts, I have a strong sense of confidence in my abilities. If a challenge arises, whether in academics or life, I know I’m capable of handling it.
	</p>
	<p>
	All in all, my life is centered around a sense of balance between logic and creativity, peace and confidence, routine and exploration. Computer science and drawing are more than hobbies to me; they’re ways of thinking and living that reflect who I am.
