    <p>
	My name is Lhyon Victor Salenga. I am someone that has always valued calm and simplicity. My routine is straightforward: I stay at home most of the time, making the most of my 24 hours on studies of my current particular interests and enjoying things that matter to me. I live near the junkshops in the west section of Orani, which gives my life a certain kind of stillness that I appreciate. This quiet lifestyle helps me focus on what I love software and drawing.

	When it comes to software, I’ve always believed that the it reflects the same peace and structure I try to maintain in my life. There’s something meditative about coding whether it’s solving a problem or creating a new program, it’s like constructing a perfect puzzle. I go through applications of algorithms and data structures with the same calm focus I apply to my everyday life. Coding allows my mind to be applied logically and methodically, but still providing room for creativity, when new solutions are needed to be developed or designed.
	</p>
	<p>
	Art, on the other hand, is where I let my mind apply its creativity in a structured logical way. Even though drawing allows for freedom, I still approach it with a sense of logic and purpose. Each line, shape, and form follows a certain flow, much like the lines of code I write when solving problems in code. There may not be strict rules in execution for art, but I there is always a method in applying my thoughts and ideas into ink and paper.
	</p>
	<p>
	For me, drawing is the construction of ideas in my mind where step by step, I go from the general forms and the biggest parts of my thoughts and slowly approach the ideals of my piece. The art I create is still imaginative, but there is a logical structure to how it is put into paper. The contrast from art and software is not all different, when after all the both of them involve problem solving in different ways and different tools. There is a balance between logic and creativity, where I experience the most joy. And the two of them complement each other in ways that allow me to think and express myself.
	</p>
	<p>
	While I enjoy the quiet life, it doesn’t mean I shy away from challenges. In both my personal life and studies, I approach problems with a calm determination. Whether it’s a complex coding project or an intricate drawing, I take the time to carefully plan my approach. And even though I tend to avoid conflicts, I have a strong sense of confidence in my abilities. If a challenge arises, whether in academics or life, I know I’m capable of handling it.
	</p>
	<p>
	All in all, my life is centered around a sense of balance between logic and creativity, peace and confidence, routine and exploration. Software and drawing are more than hobbies to me; they’re ways of thinking and living that reflect who I am.
