    <p>Recently, I've been enjoying reading. I started with reading comics such as manga/manhwa and I have read some books too. I also occasionally watch series if 
        there's something that piques my interest. I have tried to look into web development before so I was familiar with some terms. But, I am still basically a beginner
        so I hope to learn more in this course.
