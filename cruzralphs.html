    <h1>About The Members</h1>

    <p>When I started college as a BS Computer Science student, I was curious about this field. 
        I did not know what to expect and if I would stay interested in it. But now that I'm in my 3rd year,
         I can say that I am looking forward to working in this field even though there will be hardships.
          I still lack a lot but every day is a chance to learn. I hope that my experiences will help me throughout my life.
    </p> <br />
    <p>I do not know yet what is the specialization that I want to go to. I learned different stuff from the last years but
        it is not enough. Web development has piqued my interest a bit. I liked developing a page and I enjoyed experimenting
        on what can work and what can not. I still have some time to decide so for now I will just keep what I've been doing so far.
    </p> <br />
    <p>As for my hobbies, I've been enjoying my time reading something recently. I started with comics such as manga/manhwa and I have also read
        some books. I occasionally watch series if there's something I'm interested in. I do like gaming too, especially with friends. It serves
        as our bonding even though we're just at our own homes.
    </p> <br />
    <p>Growing up I didn't actually know what I wanted to become. I thought of becoming a doctor like every kid. But when college came I was reluctant
        to actually become one. I chose Computer Science and now I'm in the latter part of my college term. I have to work harder for the future opportunities
        that might appear.
    </p> <br />
    <p>I get curious about random things and when I do I try to learn more about it. I believe in this field it can be beneficial as we need to be continuously improving.
        I should treat each problem as an opportunity to learn. Because these experiences will help my growth as a person. I should also not forget to live in the 
        present and enjoy things.
    </p> <br />
